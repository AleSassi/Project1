# ProjectGit
## A small Git cheat sheet

*ProjectGit* is an open-source license-free Git cheat sheet. It contains all the main Git commands to get started with commits, push, pull and branches.

### Files

The project contains 2 files:

**Git.swift**: this is the **main** file. Written as a Swift class, it includes functions linked to Git commands, each of one is printing/returning a String value describing the necessary command to execute in Terminal.

**Test.js**: this .js file just contains some Git commands. Incomplete. For all the commands, see **Git.swift**
